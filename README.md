Running unit tests
------------------

```
apt-get install libpq-dev python3-dev libyaml-dev
pip install tox
tox --recreate -e py311
```


Running integration tests
-------------------------

You need Docker installed.

```
cd integration_tests
pip install -U -r test-requirements.txt
make test-setup
make test
```


Developing
----------

When you're developing, once you have done the setup above, you may run
integration tests faster with:

```
cd integration_tests
docker compose run sync
docker compose run purgedb  # repeat to run the tests against new code
```
